1. Change the timezone to America/New_York
    sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York

2. The US stock market open/close
      2rd Sunday, March ~ 1st Sunday, Nov  --> 9:30 to 16:00
      Other wise --> 10:30 to 17:00
      But the cron will handle this since the timezone is America/New_York.
